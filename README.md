⚙ Technical Implementation & Functional Breakdown :-

#FlightInsight – Revolutionizing Flight Feedback Management Imagine a system that doesn’t just collect feedback but intelligently discovers hidden problems, prioritizes them, and connects them directly to the expert who can fix them.

With FlightInsight, every piece of flight feedback becomes actionable. Users submit feedback about their flight experience, operational issues, or missing equipment. Behind the scenes, FlightInsight analyzes each entry for uniqueness and urgency:

-> Approved Feedback: If the system or the review team identifies a meaningful improvement or critical issue, an enhancement or action item is automatically created.

-> Rejected Feedback: Non-critical or duplicate feedback is filtered out, keeping the workflow clean and focused.

1. Tables & Fields:

   • Organizes all flight feedback and critical issues in a structured, easily retrievable way.
   
   • Ensures every data point can be analyzed, tracked, and turned into actionable insights.

2. Roles & Group Membership:

   • Controls who can see or act on feedback, making the system secure and efficient.

   • Empowers the right users to act on important issues without overwhelming others.

3. ACLs (Access Control Rules):

   • Safeguards sensitive feedback, ensuring only authorized users can access it.

   • Maintains compliance and prevents accidental or unauthorized modifications.

4. Record Producers:

   • Simplifies feedback submission, making it quick and user-friendly.

   • Encourages more accurate and consistent feedback from every flight team member.

5. Workflows:

   • Automates the journey from feedback submission to actionable alerts for specialists.

   • Ensures no critical issue gets missed, even when handling large volumes of feedback.

6. Business Rules:

   • Implements intelligent logic to validate and process feedback automatically.

   • Detects unique or major issues in real-time, reducing manual oversight.

7. Client Scripts:

   • Enhances the user interface with dynamic behavior and validation for smoother submissions.

   • Guides users to provide precise information, improving the quality of data collected.

8. UI Policies:

   • Dynamically adjusts forms to highlight critical fields, ensuring important data is captured.

   • Simplifies complex forms so users can submit feedback without confusion.

9. UI Actions:

   • Provides instant actions like ‘Approve,’ ‘Reject,’ or ‘Escalate,’ making the workflow interactive.

   • Empowers quick responses, ensuring urgent issues reach specialists immediately.

10. Registering and Triggering Events:

      • Monitors system activities and triggers automated processes for critical feedback.

      • Creates a seamless link between feedback detection and real-time action.

11. Email Notifications:

      • Sends instant alerts to specialists when critical or unique issues are detected.

      • Keeps all stakeholders informed without manual monitoring, making response faster and more efficient.
